# Customer Satisfaction Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting customer satisfaction ratings based on historical support ticket data using machine learning.

## ðŸš€ Project Objective

To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts customer satisfaction levels (ratings 1 to 5) from support ticket attributes, and to generate insights that can help improve service quality.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used

* **Excel** â€“ Data inspection, cleaning, and pivot analysis
* **SQL** â€“ Data segmentation, trend analysis
* **Python** â€“ ML modeling and feature engineering
* **Libraries** â€“ Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description

The dataset contains 8,469 support tickets with the following features:

* Customer demographics: Age, Gender
* Ticket info: Type, Channel, Priority, Status
* Date and time fields: Date of Purchase, First Response Time, Resolution Time
* Text columns: Ticket Subject, Description
* Target variable: Customer Satisfaction Rating (1 to 5)

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

* Removed rows with missing satisfaction ratings
* Dropped irrelevant text fields (e.g., Description, Resolution)
* Encoded categorical features using `LabelEncoder`
* Converted datetime features where needed
* Scaled features using `StandardScaler`

## ðŸ§  Model Used

* **RandomForestClassifier**
* Justification: Handles categorical and numeric features well, robust to non-linearity, interpretable feature importance

## ðŸ§ª Model Evaluation

* Classification Report: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
* Confusion Matrix: Visualized performance by class
* Feature Importance: Identified key drivers (e.g., Ticket Priority, Type, Channel)

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights for Business

* Proactively predict dissatisfied customers
* Identify weak support areas by product or channel
* Optimize ticket routing and prioritization strategies

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
- `Netflix_ML.ipynb`: Final data with clustering and ML insights.
- `NetflixData_Report.ppt`: Final project report PowerPoint summary.
- `netflix_final.xlsx`: Excel with visualized data
- `Netflix_SQL.sql`: SQL code for cleaning, querying, and genre analysis.

## ðŸ“Ž Future Improvements

* Use NLP to analyze ticket descriptions
* Try XGBoost or Ordinal Classification models
* Integrate model into a live dashboard/CRM
